run nodejs scripts is: `node ./global.js`
the output:
```shell
/home/igor/Projects/node-learnig
global.js:5
/home/igor/Projects/node-learnig/global.js
global.js:6
The file name is global.js
```

to run the `emmiter.js` use command like this with the extension .js: `node ./emmiter.js` in other case we will get `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error
